# Textbooks 

Hobbs, N.T., and Hooten, M.B. 2015. Bayesian models: a statistical primer for ecologists. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey.

- The best textbook I found on the fundamentals of Bayesian models from an ecologist's perspective. I've never found another book that filled in so many gaps in understanding that I had. An excellent resource on how to read and write Bayesian models. Note that this textbook does not focus on code. 

McElreath, R. 2016. Statistical rethinking: a Bayesian course with examples in R and Stan. CRC Press/Taylor & Francis Group, Boca Raton.

- A fantastic textbook that will help you think about Bayesian modeling and modeling in general. Perhaps the one downside is that it uses the author's `rethinking` R package throughout which is great for pedagogical perspective but not great if you want to learn Stan code itself. 
- See this repository that includes most of the examples reworked with the brms package and ggplot2: <https://github.com/ASKurz/Statistical_Rethinking_with_brms_ggplot2_and_the_tidyverse>

Gelman, A., and J. Hill. 2007. Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK

- An excellent textbook on regression and hierarchical modeling. Starts with lme4 and then gets into Bayesian modeling with WinBUGS/JAGS. Is currently being rewritten with Stan. Examples are mostly from the social, political, and health sciences, but applicable to anything. Also deals with causal inference.
- Note that the exercises have been translated into Stan here: <https://github.com/stan-dev/example-models/wiki/ARM-Models>

Gelman, A., J. B. Carlin, H. S. Stern, D. B. Dunson, A. Vehtari, and D. B. Rubin. 2014. Bayesian Data Analysis. Chapman & Hall, Boca Raton, FL.

- The Bayesian data analysis bible, but definitely not easy reading.
